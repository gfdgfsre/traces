Simutrace
=========

Simutrace is a tracing framework for full system simulators and has been
conceived with full length, no-loss tracing of high-frequency events such as
executed CPU instructions and main memory references in mind.

The framework places no restriction on the type and number of captured events
and employs a scalable storage format, which easily handles traces of hundreds
of gigabytes in size. Simutrace has been particularly extended to facilitate
efficient memory tracing by incorporating aggressive, but fast memory trace
compression.

Simutrace is a research project of the operating systems group at Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology (KIT).

Architecture
---------------------------

Simutrace uses a client-server architecture, where a client such as an
extension in a full system simulator collects events (e.g., memory accesses)
and a storage server receives the data, performs trace compression and storage
as well as provides easy access to the data for later analysis and inspection.
The server can be situated on the same as well as on a remote host.

When connecting to the server, the client is assigned a session and may create
a new or open an existing trace data store. Within a store, trace events are
organized into streams. Each stream stores events of a single type (e.g.,
memory writes). A client may create an arbitrary number of streams using
built-in or custom event types. Writing and reading trace data with Simutrace
thus follows common streaming semantics.

For a thorough introduction to Simutrace and its capabilities please refer to
our white paper [Efficient Full System Memory Tracing with Simutrace](about:blank).

#### Binary Files

Simutrace consists of four libraries and one executable:

<b>simustore(.exe)</b>: The server executable, containing all trace processing
and storage functionality.

<b>libsimutrace(.so/.dll)</b>: This is the client library offering the public
C interface to Simutrace. This library needs to be used by all applications
that want to use Simutrace. See http://simutrace.org/documentation for a
documentation of the API.

<b>libsimutraceX(.so/.dll)</b>: This is the client extensions library, which
provides additions on top of the standard Simutrace API such as a stream
multiplexer and helper functions.

<b>libsimubase, libsimustore</b>: These are static libraries that encapsulate
common code for the client library and the storage server. You won't see these
as build output as they are statically linked into the client library and
storage server binary, respectively.


Getting Started
---------------

In this section, we first describe the supported platforms, prerequisites and
the environment for building Simutrace from source. You may download
pre-compiled binaries at http://simutrace.org/downloads. The section continues
by giving a short introduction on how to start Simutrace.

### Supported Platforms

Simutrace supports Windows Vista+, Linux, and MacOSX 10.9+. Since trace
processing is a memory intensive task, we only support 64 bit operating system
versions. We tested Simutrace on x86-64 hardware, only.

For best performance, we recommend running the server on a system with at least
8 CPU cores (4+4) and 12 GiB of RAM. The server very well operates a 24 core
dual-socket Xeon system at full load when reading a memory trace with
700 MiB/s. The hardware requirements for the client are significantly lower as
all heavyweight processing is done in the server process. The client runs
perfectly fine on a single core with 1 GiB of RAM. When running the
client and server on the same machine, the memory of the client is shared with
the server and does not add to the server's requirements.

### Installation

This section describes the installation of one of the pre-compiled versions of
Simutrace and its prerequisites. If you cannot find a version of Simutrace on
http://simutrace.org/downloads suitable to your environment (e.g., OS), you can
build Simutrace [from source](#building-from-source).

Note: The installation does not currently include extensions for a full system
simulators to generate trace events from a simulation. For information on
simulator extensions, please refer to http://simutrace.org.

#### Step 1: Visual C++ Redistributable Package 2015 (Windows-only)

The Visual C++ Redistributable package installs run-time components that are
required to run Simutrace. Download the package from Microsoft and follow the
instructions given on the download page.

<i>If you have Visual Studio 2015 installed, the required components are
already on your system.</i>

#### Step 2: Simutrace

Download the latest version of Simutrace from http://simutrace.org/downloads.
For Windows we provide MSI installation packages. For rpm-based and deb-based
Linux distributions you can add repositories to your packaging software from
Launchpad and openSUSE Build Service. For all other supported platforms, we
currently do not provide binary packages. You have to
[build from source](#building-from-source) for these systems.

### Building from Source

If you want to make changes to Simutrace or want to run Simutrace on a platform
that is not officially supported, you can build the software from source.

#### Step 1: Setting up the Build Environment

Simutrace uses CMake (2.8 or newer) to generate build files for the
development tools available on your system.

On <b>Windows</b>, download the latest CMake version from http://cmake.org. To
build Simutrace, we use the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio
(Visual C++). A free (express) version can be downloaded from Microsoft.

On <b>Linux</b>, you have to install cmake, the basic development tools such
a C++11 compatible GCC (version 4.7 or higher) and make. Some distributions
provide a package that will install the required tools. On Ubuntu Linux 14.04
LTS you can enter:

    $ sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential

#### Step 2: Cloning the Source Repository

Before you can clone the source repository you need to install git. On
<b>Windows</b> you may install it from https://msysgit.github.io/. On
<b>Linux</b> you will most probably find a binary package in your system's
package management system. On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you can enter:

    $ sudo apt-get install git

After installing git, you clone the source repository by entering:

    $ git clone https://github.com/simutrace/simutrace.git

The repository encompasses the server, the C client interface
library to write simulator extensions and analysis clients, sample code,
documentation sources, and more.

The repository has the following structure:

<pre>
.
|-- <b>3rdParty</b>
|   `-- libconfig-1.4.9     <i>libconfig to parse configuration files</i>
|
|-- <b>samples</b>
|   |-- csharp.memreplay    <i>Memory replay sample in c#</i>

    |-- <b>libsimutrace</b>        <i>Public client library.</i>
    |-- <b>libsimutraceX</b>       <i>Public client extensions library.</i>
    `-- <b>storageserver</b>       <i>Trace storage and access server.</i>
        `-- simtrace        <i>simtrace (*.sim) storage format provider</i>
            |               <i>and type-specific trace encoders/decoders.</i>
            `-- VPC4        <i>Prediction-based memory trace compressor.</i>
</pre>

#### Step 3: Building

Before you can build the source, you have to generate the build files with
CMake. If you are using <b>Windows</b> you will most probably want to generate
a Visual Studio solution. On <b>Linux</b>, you can generate makefiles with
cmake and build Simutrace by running the following commands from the root
directory of the source tree:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    $ make

The final executables will be located in <i>bin/</i> and can be installed
using:

    $ make install

##### Debug Version

To build the debug version of Simutrace you have to choose the
appropriate solution configuration in Visual Studio (<i>Debug</i>) or
on Linux generate the makefiles with:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

### Starting Simutrace

Simutrace uses a client-server architecture. Starting Simutrace thus
constitutes starting the server on the one side and starting one or more
clients on the other side.

You start the <b>server</b> by running the main <i>simustore(.exe)</i>
executable. The server will then wait for clients to connect.

The server can take various settings to change the way it operates
and to regulate the amount of resources it allocates. We recommend downloading
the sample configuration file from our website, which contains a detailed
description of the settings available and their default values. When you build
Simutrace from source, the configuration file is already in the output
directory. To supply the file during startup, type:

    $ ./simustore -c simustore.cfg

How to start the <b>client</b>, depends on the client application. A client may
be an extension in a full system simulator, which connects to the server and
outputs all events it observes in the simulation. A client may also be an
analysis software, which reads the traces back in to perform some form of
analysis.

Simutrace does not come with any specific client application, yet. Instead we
provide samples that show you how to bind against the client library
(<i>libsimutrace(.so/.dll)</i>) and use the Simutrace API to work with the
storage server.

### Writing and Reading Traces

To write or read a trace you must develop a client application that calls
the server as desired. The client library provides a C interface for this
purpose. You may use the interface by including <i>SimuTrace.h</i>.

Note: if you wish to use a different programming language for your client,
see if and how your preferred language can bind to a native C shared/dynamic
library. For some languages we already provide bindings. Take a look at the
bindings directory for supported languages.

Please see the source of the sample clients as well as the documentation for
details on how to bind to the client library and invoke the API.


Documentation
-------------

Unfortunately, the internal classes, interfaces and components of Simutrace are
not documented, yet. However, you will find a complete documentation of the
public client API, required to write or read traces, at
http://simutrace.org/.

### Building the Documentation

The documentation in Simutrace is automatically build from source using
doxygen. On <b>Windows</b>, you will find the latest version of doxygen at
http://www.doxygen.org. On <b>Linux</b>, install doxygen with your
package management system. On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you can enter:

    $ sudo apt-get install doxygen

Afterwards, you can build the documentation by running cmake as usual and
building the <i>simutrace-doc</i> target. On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you may enter
the following commands from the root directory of the source tree:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make simutrace-doc

You will find the documentation in <i>bin/doc/html</i>.


Bugs and Feature Requests
-------------------------

A bug is a <i>demonstrable problem</i> that is caused by code in the
repository. Although we give our best to provide tools that simply work, bugs
always happen.

Guidelines for bug reports:

  - <b>Use the GitHub issue search</b> - check if the issue has already been
    reported.

  - <b>Check if the issue has been fixed</b> - try to reproduce it using the
    latest release or development branch in the repository.

  - <b>Isolate the problem</b> - ideally create a reduced test case and a live
    example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?
On which operating system do you experience the problem? Does the bug happen
on other operating systems, too? What would you expect to be the outcome?
All these details will help to fix potential bugs.

Example:

<pre>
Short and descriptive example bug report title

A summary of the issue and the environment in which it occurs. If suitable,
include the steps required to reproduce the bug.

    + This is the first step
    + This is the second step
    + Further steps, etc.

<url> - a link to the reduced test case

Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
merits).
</pre>

To report an issue please use the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/simutrace/simutrace/issues).

### Feature Requests

Since the project is primarily maintained by a single person, in most cases we
won't be able to implement requested features. Nevertheless, we would be happy
to know where Simutrace does not fulfill your requirements and from what
improvements you would benefit from.

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/simutrace/simutrace/issues)
for feature requests.

### Known Issues

For known issues, please see [KNOWN ISSUES](/KNOWNISSUES).


Versioning
----------

We try to comply with the semantic versioning scheme (http://semver.org/). If
we incorporated incompatible changes from one minor version to the other, you
will find these documented in the changelog and the API documentation. For
the current version, please refer to [VERSION](/VERSION).


Contributing
------------

Simutrace has been designed with extensibility in mind. It is particularly easy
to add support for other processing logic (e.g., for instruction flow encoding)
or trace formats. Being able to add further communication channels, such as
RDMA-based networks, has always been intended in the design, too. Platform
dependent code is encapsulated in <i>libsimubase</i>, facilitating ports of
Simutrace to operating systems other than Windows and Linux. Last but not
least, the client-server architecture makes developing trace sources (e.g.,
plug-ins for full system simulators) and analysis software straightforward.

If you want to contribute an extension to Simutrace, if you have developed a
trace source or analysis client that could be of interest to others or if you
have improved any of the existing components, please use the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/simutrace/simutrace/issues) as preferred
channel.

Before submitting extensions to Simutrace, please carefully study the
existing source. <b>Your code must adhere to the same coding style to be
accepted in the repository (formatting, exception handling, etc.)</b>.

We would be happy to see your contribution in the next release!
